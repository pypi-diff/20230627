 # AI Code Bot ü§ñ
 
 ## Your AI-powered coding companion
 
 AICodeBot is a coding assistant designed to make your coding life easier. With capabilities to perform code reviews, manage dependencies, and even suggest improvements, think of it as your AI version of a pair programmer - a team member that accelerates the pace of development and helps you write better code.
 
-‚ö†Ô∏è Status: This project is in its infancy with very limited features, but it already improves the software development workflow.
+There are lot of ways to use AICodeBot that we have planned. To start, it's a [command-line tool](https://pypi.org/project/aicodebot/) that you can use to generate commit messages, debug code, and review code. In the future, we plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions, Slack, and other tools to make it even more useful.
 
-‚ö†Ô∏è It uses OpenAI's ChatGPT large language model, which can hallucinate and be confidently wrong. Sometimes it does dumb things, which is why we have you confirm before it does anything permanent.

 ### What it's not
 
 `aicodebot` is a tool for developers, not a replacement for them. It's not going to replace your job, but it will make your job easier and more fun. It's not going to take over the world, but it will help us build a better one. See the *Alignment* section below for more.
 
-It's also not a "build a website for me in 5 minutes" tool that takes a well constructed prompt and builds a scaffold for you. There are [other tools](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) for that, Instead, it's built to work with existing code bases and help you improve them at the git-commit level. It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.

 `aicodebot review` will run a code review on your code and suggest improvements. By default it will look at [un]staged changes, and you can also supply a specific commit hash to review. It also suggests best practices for code improvement.
 
 ## Getting Started
 
 [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/aicodebot.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/aicodebot)
 
-To install the command line interface, run `pip install aicodebot`. You'll also need to set up an OpenAI API key, which you can get for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
-
-Follow the steps below to set up AICodeBot on your machine:
+To install AICodeBot, run:
 
 `pip install aicodebot`
 
-Note:
+And then run `aicodebot --help` to get started.
+
+```bash
+Usage: aicodebot [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
+
+Options:
+  -V, --version  Show the version and exit.
+  -h, --help     Show this message and exit.

+
+### Open AI key setup
+
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
 
+Pro tip: You can also set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key, and it will use that instead of prompting you.

 ## Alignment ‚ù§Ô∏è + ü§ñ
 
 Technology itself is amoral, it just imbues the values of the engineers who create it. We believe that AI should be built in a way that aligns with humanity, and we're building aicodebot to help us do just that. We're building from a heart-centered space, and contributing to the healthy intersection of AI and humanity.

 # AI Code Bot ü§ñ
 
 ## Your AI-powered coding companion
 
 AICodeBot is a coding assistant designed to make your coding life easier. With capabilities to perform code reviews, manage dependencies, and even suggest improvements, think of it as your AI version of a pair programmer - a team member that accelerates the pace of development and helps you write better code.
 
-‚ö†Ô∏è Status: This project is in its infancy with very limited features, but it already improves the software development workflow.
+There are lot of ways to use AICodeBot that we have planned. To start, it's a [command-line tool](https://pypi.org/project/aicodebot/) that you can use to generate commit messages, debug code, and review code. In the future, we plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions, Slack, and other tools to make it even more useful.
 
-‚ö†Ô∏è It uses OpenAI's ChatGPT large language model, which can hallucinate and be confidently wrong. Sometimes it does dumb things, which is why we have you confirm before it does anything permanent.

 ### What it's not
 
 `aicodebot` is a tool for developers, not a replacement for them. It's not going to replace your job, but it will make your job easier and more fun. It's not going to take over the world, but it will help us build a better one. See the *Alignment* section below for more.

It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.

 ## Getting Started

+### Open AI key setup
+
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
 
+Pro tip: You can also set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key, and it will use that instead of prompting you.

-```bash
-git clone git@github.com:novara-ai/aicodebot.git
-```
-
-2. Set up a virtual environment (I recommend using [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
-
-```bash
-mkvirtualenv --python=`which python3` aicodebot
-```
-
-3. Install the dependencies:
-
-```bash
-pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
-```
-
-4. Use aicodebot to build aicodebot üòé
-
-### Testing
-
-Install the test dependencies with
-`pip install -r requirements/requirements-test.txt`
-
-We use `pytest` for testing. It will skip some tests if OPENAI_API_KEY is not set.
-
-### Coding Principles
-
-Borrowed from the [zen of python](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonPhilosophy), with a couple of changes.
-
-```text
-1. **Readability is the number 1 code quality metric**.
-2. Beautiful is better than ugly.
-3. Explicit is better than implicit.
-4. Simple is better than complex.
-5. Complex is better than complicated.
-6. Flat is better than nested.
-7. Sparse is better than dense.
-8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
-    * Although practicality beats purity.
-9. Errors should never pass silently.
-    * Unless explicitly silenced.
-10. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
-11. There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
-12. Now is better than never.
-```
